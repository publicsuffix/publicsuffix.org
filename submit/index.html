            Submit amendments to the Public Suffix List
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to make the Public Suffix List (PSL) as current and accurate 
            as possible, we request that Top-Level Domain (TLD) registries put in 
            place processes to keep their section of the list current and accurate. 
            This will make sure that all sites within their TLD continue to 
            function fully within modern browsers, in terms of the site owners' 
            ability to set cookies, request certificates and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, owners of privately-registered domains who themselves
            issue subdomains to mutually-untrusting parties may wish to be
            added to the PRIVATE section of the list.
        <p>
            The procedure to make changes is via submitting pull-requests on GitHub, 
            and that process, acceptance criteria, formatting and structure, etc. are 
            <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Guidelines">documented on our wiki</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Requests for changes to the PRIVATE section MUST come from the
            domain owner</strong> - we have this verification rule to ensure that 
            domain owners are fully aware of the addition or change and understand 
            the consequences and impacts of a domain being added to the list.
            We will not make additions to this section if they are requested
            by third parties.  We will generally decline small projects or 
            expirimental / lab requests or short term entries.
            The PSL is not intended to be any indication of security or trust, nor 
            should projects, companies, corporations or advertising firms direct 
            their users to submit PSL requests to bypass rate limits or 
            internet user protections from tracking.
            Requests for changes to the ICANN section either need
            to come from the registry, ICANN or the IANA and be provided 
            with links to supporting official documentation.
