            A "public suffix" is one under which Internet users can (or historically could) directly register names. Some examples of public suffixes are <samp>.com</samp>, <samp>.co.uk</samp> and <samp>pvt.k12.ma.us</samp>. The Public Suffix List is a list of all known public suffixes.

        <p>
            The Public Suffix List is an initiative of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, but is maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Avoid privacy-damaging "supercookies" being set for high-level domain name suffixes
            </li>
            <li>
                Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user interface
            </li>
            <li>
                Accurately sort history entries by site
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We maintain a <a href="/learn/">fuller (although not exhaustive) list</a> of what people are using it for. If you are using it for something else, you are encouraged to <a href="mailto:contact@publicsuffix.org">tell us</a>, because it helps us to assess the potential impact of changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is in the interest of Internet registries to see that their section of the list is up to date. If it is not, their customers may have trouble setting cookies, or data about their sites may display sub-optimally. So we encourage them to maintain their section of the list by <a href="/submit/">submitting amendments</a>.
